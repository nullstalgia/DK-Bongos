# Project-Bongo
This project has two branches (master and uno-nano). Two Arduinos are required for it to work:
1. a Teensy 3.2 or 3.5 with code from the master branch
2. an Arduino Uno/Nano with code from the uno-nano branch  

A wiring diagram will be included soon:tm:.  

The goal of this project is to make bongos playable in any situation outside Jungle Beats or Donkey Konga without modifying the controller itself.
