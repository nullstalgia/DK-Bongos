# Project-Bongo
The goal of this project is to make the Donkey Kong Bongos a controller playable in Super Smash Bros using an Arduino Nano. For awhile, I used this repo for testing all sorts of things with other controllers and Arduinos. All that is available in branches other than `master` with various documentation on the Wiki. Will continue development on those ideas in other repos.
