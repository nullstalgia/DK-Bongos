# DK-Bongos
Expanding on the DK Bongos

I originally created this project to find the best way to make the Donkey Kong Bongos a tournament legal and competitive Smash Bros game controller. The code here is deprecated, because I discovered that the best way did not require any programmable logic. However, I have left it here so that others may learn what took me several school breaks to hunt down. Further development on the bongos will be done on this Wiki and my YouTube. Thank you to all my mentors and friends who taught me and encouraged me to keep moving forward!
